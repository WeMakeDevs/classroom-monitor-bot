    ![fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/Fork.jpg)

### Clone repository

## Contributing

Before getting started, make sure you have Developer Mode enabled in your Discord.
If you're not sure how to enable it, go to `Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode: ON`

### Creating a branch

Whenever you want to contribute to any project, it is a good practice to make a separate branch and push it as a PR, rather than making changes to the main/master branch.

1. `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` will make a separate branch and will change to that branch
2. Now you are ready to make your changes.

### Setting up application and creating the bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) page
2. Login with your Discord credentials. You will see the following screen (image below and for you, it will probably be a blank one)
    ![homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/HomePage.jpg)
3. Now click the `New Application` button (refer to the image above)
4. Name your bot (it can be `We Make Devs bot` or anything else) and press `create`
5. You will be at the Developers Portal where you can customize your bot (refer to the image below)
    ![dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/Dashboard.jpg)
6. Now to create your bot instance go to the `Bot` tab, and press `Add Bot` followed by `Yes, do it` in the following popup (refer to the image below)
    ![bot instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/BotInstance.jpg)
7. You will be redirected to something similar to this screen
    ![after adding bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/After_adding_bot.jpg)
8. Go to `OAuth2` and copy the Client ID (refer to the image below)
    ![App ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/app_id.jpg)
9. Now to invite the bot to your server, paste this link in your browser `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<app-id>&permissions=8&scope=bot` and just replace `<app-id>` with your copied client ID
10. You will be redirected to this screen (image below) where you have to select a server and click on `continue` and `authorize` after that
    ![Add server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/add_server.jpg)

##### Amazing! You have added the bot to your server; although you might see it's offline. Let's make it go online!

### Coding our Bot

1. Open the folder of your cloned repository with any text editor of your choice (VSCode recommended)
2. Now go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) page where you created the bot and copy the bot token from the `Bot` tab (refer to the image below)
    ![Bot Token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/BotToken.jpg)
3. Now create a file named`.env` in your root folder. Copy everything from the `.env-sample` file and replace the `BOT-TOKEN` value with the copied token. Note that the `.env` file should be nameless. Create a nameless file, with the extension `.env`. If you add a name to the file, NPM won't be able to access the token.
4. In the terminal run, `npm install`, this will install all the necessary packages
5. Start our server by running `npm start`.
6. All done! The bot is now online!

## Commit Message

After making the desired changes and testing, run the `git add .` command to add the files to the Git staging area. This area contains a list of all the files you have recently changed.

`git commit -m <Type in the commit message>` to commit your changes and save them to the local repository.

##### We follow conventional commits specifications for our commit messages

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```markdown
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters.

#### Commit Message Header

```markdown
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  â”‚       â”‚             â”‚
  â”‚       â”‚             â””â”€â«¸ Summary in the present tense. Not capitalized. No period in the end.
  â”‚       â”‚
  â”‚       â””â”€â«¸ Commit Scope: animations|bazel|benchpress|common|compiler|compiler-cli|core|
  â”‚                          elements|forms|http|language-service|localize|platform-browser|
  â”‚                          platform-browser-dynamic|platform-server|router|service-worker|
  â”‚                          upgrade|zone.js|packaging|changelog|dev-infra|docs-infra|migrations|
  â”‚                          ngcc|ve
  â”‚
  â””â”€â«¸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory. The `(<scope>)` field is optional.

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

* `feat`     Commits that adds a new feature
* `fix`      Commits that fixes a bug
* `refactor` Commits that rewrite/restructure your code, however, does not change any behavior
* `perf`     Commits that are special `refactor` commits that improve performance
* `style`    Commits that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
* `test`     Commits that add missing tests or correct existing tests
* `docs`     Commits that affect documentation only
* `build`    Commits that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, etc.
* `ops`   Commits that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, etc.
* `chore`    Miscellaneous commits. E.g.: modifying `.gitignore`

##### Scope

The `scope` provides additional contextual information.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Allowed Scopes depend on the specific project
- Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "fix", not "fixed" nor "fixes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (`.`) at the end
- Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks

#### Commit Message Body

- The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes"
- This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

#### Commit Message Footer

The `footer` can contain information about breaking changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to.

```markdown
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

The "Breaking Change" section should start with the phrase `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

It's an **optional** part of the format.

### Creating commits

```bash
type: :emoji: summary (changes made)
```

To know which `type` to use, refer to [this](#type)

To find suitable/appropriate emojis for the changes, refer to [this](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a)

Not sure what to type in the summary? Refer to [this](#summary)

#### Some of the tips to write a good commit message

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
- Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it.
- Do not think your code is self-explanatory
- Follow the commit convention defined by your team

#### Example

```bash
feat: :sparkles: add the amazing button
```
