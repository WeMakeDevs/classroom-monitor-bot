### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible!

## Contributing

Before getting started, make sure you have Developer Mode enabled in your Discord.
If you're not sure how to enable it, go to `Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode: ON`

### Creating a branch

Whenever you want to contribute to any project, it is a good practice to make a separate branch and push it as a PR, rather than making changes to the main/master branch.

1. `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` will make a separate branch and will change to that branch.
2. Now you are ready to make your changes.

### Setting up application and creating bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) page
2. Login with your Discord credentials. You will see the following screen (image below and for you it will probably be a blank one)
    ![homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/HomePage.jpg)
3. Now click the `New Application` button (refer to the image above)
4. Name your bot (it can be `Community Classroom bot` or anything else) and press `create`
5. You will be at the Developers Portal where you can customize your bot (refer to the image below)
    ![dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/Dashboard.jpg)
6. Now to create your bot instance go to `Bot` tab, and press `Add Bot` followed by `Yes, do it` in the following popup (refer to the image below)
    ![bot instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/BotInstance.jpg)
7. You will be redirected to something similar to this screen
    ![after adding bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/After_adding_bot.jpg)
8. Go to `OAuth2` and copy the Client ID (refer to the image below)
    ![App ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/app_id.jpg)
9. Now to invite the bot to your server, paste this link in your browser `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<app-id>&permissions=8&scope=bot` and just replace `<app-id>` with your copied client ID
10. You will be redirected to this screen (image below) where you have to select a server and click on `continue` and `authorize` after that
    ![Add server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/add_server.jpg)

##### Amazing! You have added the bot to your server; although you might see it's offline. Let's make it go online!

### Coding our Bot

1. Open the folder of your cloned repository with any text editor of your choice (VSCode recommended)
2. Now go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) page where you created the bot and copy the bot token from `Bot` tab(refer to image below)
    ![Bot Token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commclassroom/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/BotToken.jpg)
3. Now create file named`.env` in your root folder. Copy everything from the `.env-sample` file and replace the `BOT-TOKEN` value with the copied token. Note that the `.env` file should be nameless. Create a nameless file, with the extension `.env`. If you add a name to the file, NPM won't be able to access the token
4. In the terminal run, `npm install`, this will install all the necessary packages
5. Start our server by running `npm start`
6. All done! The bot is now online!

- Allowed Scopes depend on the specific project
- Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "fix", not "fixed" nor "fixes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (`.`) at the end
- Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks

#### Commit Message Body

- The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.

It's an **optional** part of the format.

### Creating commits

```bash
type: :emoji: summary (changes made)
```

#### Some of the tips to write good commit message

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
- Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it
- Do not think your code is self-explanatory
- Follow the commit convention defined by your team

#### Example

```bash
feat: :sparkles: add the amazing button
```
