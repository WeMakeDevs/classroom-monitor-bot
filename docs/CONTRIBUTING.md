### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Creating a branch

Whenever you want to contribute to any project, it is a good practice to make a separate branch and push it as a PR, rather than making changes to the main/master branch.

1. `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` will make a separate branch and will change to that branch
2. Now you are ready to make your changes.

### Setting up application and creating bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) page
2. Login with your Discord credentials. You will see the following screen (image below and for you it will probably be a blank one)
    ![homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/HomePage.jpg)
3. Now click the `New Application` button (refer to the image above)
4. Name your bot (it can be `Community Classroom bot` or anything else) and press `create`
5. You will be at the Developers Portal where you can customize your bot (refer to the image below)
    ![dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/Dashboard.jpg)
6. Now to create your bot instance go to `Bot` tab, and press `Add Bot` followed by `Yes, do it` in the following popup (refer to the image below)
    ![bot instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/BotInstance.jpg)
7. You will be redirected to something similar to this screen
    ![after adding bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/After_adding_bot.jpg)
8. Go to `OAuth2` and copy the Client ID (refer to the image below)
    ![App ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/app_id.jpg)
9. Now to invite the bot to your server, paste this link in your browser `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<app-id>&permissions=8&scope=bot` and just replace `<app-id>` with your copied client ID
10. You will be redirected to this screen (image below) where you have to select a server and click on `continue` and `authorize` after that
    ![Add server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/add_server.jpg)

##### Amazing! You have added the bot to your server; although you might see it's offline. Let's make it go online!

### Coding our Bot

1. Open the folder of your cloned repository with any text editor of your choice (VSCode recommended)
2. Now go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) page where you created the bot and copy the bot token from `Bot` tab(refer to image below)
    ![Bot Token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/main/doc/images/BotToken.jpg)
3. Now create file named`.env` in your root folder. Copy everything from the `.env-sample` file and replace the `BOT-TOKEN` value with the copied token. Note that the `.env` file should be nameless. Create a nameless file, with the extension `.env`. If you add a name to the file, NPM won't be able to access the token.
4. In the terminal run, `npm install`, this will install all the necessary packages
5. Start our server by running `npm start`.
6. All done! The bot is now online!

##### Scope

The `scope` provides additional contextual information.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Allowed Scopes depend on the specific project
- Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "fix", not "fixed" nor "fixes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (`.`) at the end
- Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks

#### Commit Message Body

- The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes"
- This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

#### Commit Message Footer

The `footer` can contain information about breaking changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to.

```markdown
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

The "Breaking Change" section should start with the phrase `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

It's an **optional** part of the format.

### Creating commits

```bash
type: :emoji: summary (changes made)
```

To know which `type` to use, refer to [this](#type)

To find suitable/appropriate emojis for the changes, refer to [this](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a)

Not sure what to type in the summary? Refer to [this](#summary)

#### Some of the tips to write good commit message

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
- Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it.
- Do not think your code is self-explanatory
- Follow the commit convention defined by your team

#### Example

```bash
feat: :sparkles: add the amazing button
```
