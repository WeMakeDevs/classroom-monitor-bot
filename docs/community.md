## Testimonials

> I’ve been programming professionally for 20 years, and I’m damn good at it; still, I’ve been following along with Kunal’s DSA course and I’m learning stuff. It’s a whole lot of fun. Kunal is passionate and entertaining while explaining CS topics for all to understand **-David Flanagan**

> I am following WeMakeDevs's bootcamp and found it really useful. I am getting all the concepts taught so far crystal cleared as well as able to solve leetcode questions given in their assignments. Before this I was finding leetcode very difficult. **-Anurag Pathak**
