### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible!
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

    <img src="./doc/images/Fork.jpg" alt="Demo fork image"/>

### Clone repository

1. Now after you have forked your project its time to clone it into your local device so that you can work on it
2. In your forked repository click on the green code button and copy the provided link. In case of any difficulty refer to the image below
    <img src="./doc/images/Clone.jpg" alt="Demo copy image"/>
3. Now in your desktop open `git bash` and type `git clone <your-clone-url>.git` and press enter
4. Now, your forked repo has been cloned in your device 

## Contributing

Before starting make sure you have developer mode enabled in your discord
If not then got to `Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode: ON`

### Creating a branch

Whenever you want to contribute to any project it is a good practice to make a separate branch and push it as PR rather than making changes to the main/master branch

1. `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` will make a separate branch and will take you to it
2. Now you are ready to make your desired changes

### Setting up application and creating bot

1. First visit [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2. Login with your discord credentials and will see the screen(image below and for you it will probably be a blank one)
    <img src="./doc/images/HomePage.jpg" alt="home page">
3. Now click the `New Application` button(refer to image above)
4. Name your bot and press `create` 
5. Now you will appear at the application dashboard where you can customize your bot(refer to image below)
    <img src="./doc/images/Dashboard.jpg" alt="dashboard">
6. Now to create your bot instance go to `Bot` tab and press`Add Bot` followed by `Yes,do it` in the following popup(refer to image below)
    <img src="./doc/images/BotInstance.jpg" alt="bot instance">
7. Now you will appear to this screen(image below)
    <img src="./doc/images/After_adding_bot.jpg" alt="bot dashboard">
8. Go to `OAuth2` and copy the client id(refer to image below)
    <img src="./doc/images/app_id.jpg" alt="bot dashboard">
9. Now to invite the bot to your server, paste this link in your browser `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<app-id>&permissions=8&scope=bot` and just replace `<app-id>` with your copied client id
10. Now you will be redirected to this screen(image below) where you have to select a server and click on `continue` and `authorize` after that
    <img src="./doc/images/add_server.jpg" alt="server page">

##### Now your bot will be added to your server but it is still offline. So let's start...

### Coding our Bot

1. Open the folder of your cloned repository with any text editor of your choice
2. Now go to developers portal where you created the bot and copy the bot token from `Bot` tab(refer to image below)
    <img src="./doc/images/BotToken.jpg" alt="bot token">
3. Now create a `.env` file in your root folder and copy everything from `.env-sample` file and replace the `BOT-TOKEN` value with the copied token. Note that the `.env` file should be nameless. Create a file with no name, and just the extenstion of `.env`. If you add a name to the file, `npm start` will not be able to access the token.
4. In the terminal run `npm install`, this will install all the packages
5. Then to start our server run `npm start`, this will start our server and the bot will be online

## Commit Message

After making the desired changes and testing use `git add .` command to add the files to the Git staging area. This area contains a list of all the files you have recently changed. 

`git commit -m <Type in the commit message>` to commit your changes to save your changes to the local repository.

<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

Breaking Change section should start with the phrase "BREAKING CHANGE: " followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

It's an **optional** part of the format.


### Creating commits

* ```
  type: :emoji: summary (changes made)
  ```

To know which `type` to use refer [this](#type)

For summary refer [this](#summary)


#### Some of the tips to write good commit message

* Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
* Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
* Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
* Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it.
* Do not think your code is self-explanatory
* Follow the commit convention defined by your team
